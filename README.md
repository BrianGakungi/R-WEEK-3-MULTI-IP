**INTRODUCTION**
In trying to understand online customer behaviour I was tasked with analysing the data from 2 different companies i.e a Kenyan business and a Russian business by the name of Kira Plastinina. I have applied supervised learning models on the Kenyan business' data to try and understand what would drive a customer to click on an ad on its website. I have also applied unsupervised learning models on the Russian business in order to draw insights from the dataset.


**APPROACH**
To draw insights from the Kenyan business data as to what drives customers to click on ads on its website I implemented:
a.)Univariate and Bivariate analaysis
b.)Multiple linear regression
c.)Decision trees

To draw insights from the Russian dataset as to what drives customer behaviour I implemented:
a.)K-Means clustering
b.)Hierarchical clustering
c.)DBSCAN clustering


**DATASETS**
The following datasets were provided:
a.) The Kenyan business: http://bit.ly/IPAdvertisingData
b.) Kira Plastinina: http://bit.ly/EcommerceCustomersDataset

**TECHNOLOGIES/LANGUAGES USED**
a.) IDE - I used Rstudio version 2022.02.3+492
b.) R programming language

**TO SET UP THE ENVIRONMENT FOR RUNNING THE PROJECT:**
a.) Visit https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ to download the latest R studio software
b.) For beginners encountering issues detailed documentation and manuals exist as to how to manouvre around R on https://www.r-project.org/about.html
