**INTRODUCTION**
In trying to formulate a strategy to aid Carrefour in increasing its total sales inclusive of tax I was tasked with analysing datasets provided by the retail giant. I have applied dimensionality reduction, feature selection, association rules and anomaly detection on the  business' data provided by the retail giant in order to come up with a solution. I have also applied unsupervised learning models on the data in order to draw insights from the dataset.


**APPROACH**
To draw insights from Carrefour's business data as to what strategy would best improve their total sales I implemented:
a.)Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis(PCA)
b.)Feature selection using correlation coefficient and feature ranking
c.)Association rules
d.)Anomaly detection


**DATASETS**
The following datasets were provided by the company all of which are in comma separated value(csv) format:
a.) Dataset 1(USED FOR BOTH DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION & FEATURE SELECTION): http://bit.ly/CarreFourDataset
b.) Dataset 2(USED FOR ASSOCIATION RULES): http://bit.ly/SupermarketDatasetII
c.) Dataset 3(USED FOR ANOMALY DETECTION): http://bit.ly/CarreFourSalesDataset

**TECHNOLOGIES/LANGUAGES USED**
a.) IDE - I used Rstudio version 2022.02.3+492
b.) R programming language
C.) R-Pubs - I published all 3 notebooks on the rpubs website

**TO SET UP THE ENVIRONMENT FOR RUNNING THE PROJECT:**
a.) Visit https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ to download the latest R studio software
b.) For beginners encountering issues detailed documentation and manuals exist as to how to manouvre around R on https://www.r-project.org/about.html
c.) The 3 notebooks on which the analysis was done can be reviewed on the rpubs links provided at the beginning of the readme file
